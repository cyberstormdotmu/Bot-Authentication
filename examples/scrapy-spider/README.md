This example aims to showcase integration of web-bot-auth library as a [scrapy downloader middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html).

The project has a predefined spider which you can use to fetch a given URL.

```shell
 scrapy runspider examples/scrapy-spider/main.py
```
